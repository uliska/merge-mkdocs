# merge-mkdocs

This tool makes it possible to combine/merge a number of sites generated with
[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) into a single multi-document site. The aim of
this is to have multiple interdependent books with mostly identical
configurations, which can be configured with template values, e.g. for the
subbooks' color schemes.

This can be used to conceptually have one additional layer of navigation, which
can be useful for large projects, cleaner separation between subparts of a
documentation project, for example when documenting packages or plugins within a
library. Subbooks can also be maintained in separate repositories with
individual access privileges.

The project and each subbook are configured with several configuration files,
which also provide the nice side-effect of separating the site configuration
from the navigation structure. There are several strategies of incorporating the
sibling books in the navigational structure of the site, which is particularly
useful in combination with the `tabs` feature of the
[Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material) theme.

The script's `build` recipe includes postprocessing of the search indexes
generated by MkDocs, with the effect that the search field can be used to search
over the whole site as if it were a single MkDocs site.
