# mkdocs-library

This tool makes it possible to combine/merge a number of sites generated with
[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) into a single multi-document site, or library.
The aim of this is to have multiple interdependent books with mostly identical
configurations, which can be configured through templates to have slightly
different properties

There are basically two use cases: creating large sites with one additional
conceptual navigation layer, or to create a library of interdependent books,
for example documenting multiple packages within a library. In this case the
sub-books may be maintained in separate repositories with independent access
permissions.

The project and each subbook are configured with several configuration files,
which also provide the nice side-effect of separating the site configuration
from the navigation structure. There are several strategies of incorporating the
sibling books in the navigational structure of the site, which is particularly
useful in combination with the `tabs` feature of the
[Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material) theme.

The script provides a number of tasks that can be combined through command line
"recipes":

* merge-sources (combine the templates)
* build (ask MkDocs to build the books)
* merge-indexes (combine the search indexes generated by MkDocs)
* deploy (call a custom script provided by the project.

*These are just the initial commits, documentation will follow ...*
